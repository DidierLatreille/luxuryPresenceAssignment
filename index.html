                <p class="paragraphSection">
                    One of the biggest perks of working
                     with a real estate agent is their ability
                     to market your property to the right target
                     audience. <br> <br> A professional agent with the right experience
                     will be able to identify who will be interested in
                     your property <br> and implement effective strategies to
                     reach them via their website, paid advertising, social media,
                     and other means. <br> <br> When you work with an agent who has partnered
                     with Luxury Presence, you benefit from the many different
                     types of marketing capabilities the company offers. Here is how:

                    <p class="paragraphRToHireBB">
                        To reach your potential buyers,
                         you have to know who they are,
                         where they spend their time online,
                         and how they make their buying decisions.

                         Agents who use luxury real estate marketing
                         services are able to identify your niche market,
                         then create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram,
                         and YouTube that reach those interested in your property.
                         <br> <br>
                         These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and targeted,
                         ensuring you are not spending money marketing to those who are
                         not in the market for a property such as yours.

                    <p class="paragraphRToHireWB">
                        Content is one of the most powerful resources
                         a real estate agent has to promote your property.
                         Being able to create high-quality content such as
                         video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates
                         the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services
                         above their competitors. 
                         <br> <br>
                          According to a recent survey,
                         85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an
                         agent who uses video—and for good reason. An agent who
                         uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a
                         deeper level and build trust and rapport. When they use
                         video to market your property, they are showing viewers
                         what it would really be like to walk through and live
                         in your home—something that is much more difficult to
                         do with a written description.
                         <br> <br>
                         However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also
                         important. Your property needs to be described in
                         appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any
                         additional marketing that is created to sell it.
                         Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to
                         experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs, website
                         copy, and content marketing pieces that make your
                         property attractive to potential buyers.

                    <p class="paragraphRToHireWB">
                        Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found
                         the home they purchased on the internet. Many of
                         them simply googled the search terms that they wanted
                         in a new home and started their search that way.
                         <br> <br>
                         For your home to show up in these types of searches,
                         your real estate agent needs to use the right terms
                         in your online marketing. The effective use of these
                         terms is referred to as search engine optimization or SEO.
                         <br> <br>
                         The process of identifying and correctly using the right
                         terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO experts at
                         Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer
                         searches terms that match your home, your property will
                         show up in the results and provide opportunities for the
                         buyer to learn more.

                    <p class="paragraphRToHireBB">
                        If your real estate agent is an influencer on
                         social media, he or she has access to thousands
                         of niche buyers who are ready to invest in property.
                         <br> <br>
                         To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate
                         a large chunk of their time to social media or they
                         need to partner with luxury real estate marketing
                         service providers who can put in the work for them.
                         Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent his or her time
                         marketing your property and let an expert handle their
                         social media presence? 
                         <br> <br>
                         At Luxury Presence, our dedicated
                         success team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts
                         to help them go viral and become an authority in their
                         industry. Once they’ve harnessed the power of becoming an
                         influencer, they can use their voice to advocate for your
                         home and sell it more quickly than their competitors.
